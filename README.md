# Project Description

Part-of-Speech tagging is an important part of many natural language processing pipelines where the words in a sentence are marked with their respective parts of speech. 
An example application of part-of-speech (POS) tagging is chunking. Chunking is the process of marking multiple words in a sentence to combine them into larger “chunks”. 
These chunks can then later be used for tasks such as named-entity recognition.
